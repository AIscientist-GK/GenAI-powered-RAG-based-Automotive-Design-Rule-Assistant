#  GenAI-powered (RAG-based) Vehicle Design Rule Assistant

This project is an AI-powered assistant that helps automotive engineers quickly access and understand **vehicle design rules** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
It integrates **LLMs (Large Language Models)** with a **vector database** to retrieve and generate accurate, context-aware responses from vehicle design rule documents.

---

##  Features
- Upload & process design rule documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Semantic search using embeddings (ChromaDB / FAISS)
- Context-aware answers powered by LLMs (OpenAI / HuggingFace)
- Ensures compliance with JLR vehicle design rules
- Fast, scalable, and developer-friendly

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **OpenAI API** (LLM integration)
- **ChromaDB / FAISS** (Vector DB for semantic search)
- **LangChain** (RAG pipeline)
- **Streamlit / FastAPI** (Frontend / API layer)
